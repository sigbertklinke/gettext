Description: Based on PO files the package implements a subset of 'GNU gettext' commands for localization of messages: gettext, ngettext, xgettext and bindtextdomain. It allows to extract all texts from an R program and to create a POT file. A gettextified version of the R program can be created. On startup the default language is set to english and can be changed within R without affecting LANG, the system language.
