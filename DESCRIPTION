Description: Based on PO files the package implements a subset of 'GNU gettext' commands for localization of messages, for example gettext("my message"), ngettext("%0.f error", "%0.f errors", 3), xgettext("my R file") and bindtextdomain("my domain", "path to PO files dir"). It allows to extract all texts from an R program and to create a POT file. A gettextified version of the R program can be created. On startup the default language is set to English and can be changed within R without affecting LANG (or LC_ALL), the system language.
